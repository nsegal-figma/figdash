# Story E1.004: Create Project Structure

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a frontend engineer I want to scaffold a well-organized directory structure for the new visualization system So that the team has a clear, consistent place to add new components and utilities

## Description
Create the complete directory structure for the charts-v2 visualization system. This includes folders for primitives, composed charts, containers, hooks, and utilities. Set up barrel exports, TypeScript path aliases, and README files explaining the purpose of each directory.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Directory structure created matching architecture spec:
2. Index files created with exports in each directory
3. TypeScript path aliases configured in tsconfig.json
4. Barrel exports working (import { BarChart } from '@/components/charts-v2')
5. README.md created in each directory explaining its purpose
6. .gitkeep files in empty directories
7. Storybook configured to discover new components
8. Documentation updated with architecture diagram
9. . All components must be TypeScript with full type safety
10. . All components must support dark mode
11. . All components must be accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA)
12. . All components must have Storybook stories
13. . All components must have unit tests

## Tasks / Subtasks
_To be filled by Scrum Master during story refinement_

- [ ] Task 1: Review acceptance criteria
- [ ] Task 2: Implement core functionality
- [ ] Task 3: Write tests
- [ ] Task 4: Update documentation

### Testing

Manual Tests
# Test imports work

echo "import { BarChart } from '@/components/charts-v2';" > test.ts

npx tsc --noEmit test.ts

# Should have no errors (even though BarChart doesn't exist yet)

# Test Storybook

npm run storybook

# Should start without errors
Verification Checklist
	•	TypeScript compilation passes
	•	No import errors in VS Code
	•	IntelliSense works for path aliases
	•	Storybook starts without errors
