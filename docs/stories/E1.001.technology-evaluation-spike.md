# Story E1.001: Technology Evaluation Spike

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a frontend engineer I want to evaluate three visualization libraries by building the same chart in each So that we can make an informed decision on which library provides the best performance, developer experience, and customization capabilities for our needs

## Description
Conduct a hands-on technical evaluation of three visualization libraries:

	•	Visx (D3 + React primitives)
	•	Tremor (purpose-built for dashboards)
	•	Enhanced Recharts (our current library with improvements)

Build an identical bar chart with 100 data points in each library and compare them across multiple dimensions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a spike branch: spike/viz-library-evaluation
2. Install all three libraries in isolation
3. Build identical bar chart prototype in Visx
4. With hover states
5. With tooltip
6. With responsive sizing
7. Build identical bar chart prototype in Tremor
8. Same features as above
9. Build identical bar chart prototype with enhanced Recharts
10. Same features as above
11. Document bundle size impact for each (use webpack-bundle-analyzer)
12. Visx: ___ KB
13. Tremor: ___ KB
14. Recharts enhanced: ___ KB
15. Benchmark render performance (React DevTools Profiler)
16. Initial render time
17. Re-render time on data update
18. Interaction latency
19. Evaluate developer experience:
20. TypeScript support quality
21. Documentation completeness
22. API ergonomics (1-10 rating)
23. Customization flexibility (1-10 rating)
24. Community support & maintenance
25. Create EVALUATION.md with findings and recommendation
26. Present findings to team in 15-minute demo
27. Get team consensus on library choice

## Tasks / Subtasks
_To be filled by Scrum Master during story refinement_

- [ ] Task 1: Review acceptance criteria
- [ ] Task 2: Implement core functionality
- [ ] Task 3: Write tests
- [ ] Task 4: Update documentation

## Dev Notes

Setup
# Create spike directory

mkdir -p spike

cd spike

# Install candidates

npm install @visx/scale @visx/shape @visx/axis @visx/grid @visx/tooltip

npm install @tremor/react

# Recharts already installed in main project

# For bundle analysis

npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
Test Data
const testData = Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => ({

  label: `Item ${i + 1}`,

  value: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),

}));
Benchmark Criteria
	•	Performance: Render time <100ms (target)
	•	Bundle Size: Additional <50KB (target)
	•	TypeScript: Full type safety, no any casts needed
	•	Customization: Can we achieve the ultra-minimal aesthetic?
	•	Learning Curve: Can team be productive in 1 week?


### Testing

•	Each prototype renders without errors
	•	Each prototype is responsive (test at 320px, 768px, 1440px)
	•	All interactions work in all three prototypes
	•	Performance measurements are repeatable (run 3 times, average)


Resources
	•	Visx docs: https://airbnb.io/visx
	•	Tremor docs: https://tremor.so
	•	Recharts docs: https://recharts.org
	•	Bundle analyzer: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer


Success Metrics
	•	Clear winner identified (or informed decision on trade-offs)
	•	Team confidence in chosen library: 8/10 or higher
	•	Recommendation supported by quantitative data
	•	Path forward is unblocked
